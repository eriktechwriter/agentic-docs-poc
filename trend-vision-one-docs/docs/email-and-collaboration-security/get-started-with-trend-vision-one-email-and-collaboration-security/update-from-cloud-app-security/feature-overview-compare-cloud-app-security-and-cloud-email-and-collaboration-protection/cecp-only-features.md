<li><p>User-reported email analysis and response</p>
<p>Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection supports enhanced capabilities for analyzing and responding to user-reported emails. The system automatically identifies threats like phishing or spam, rescans historical emails for similar risks, and enables manual or automatic actions to mitigate and prevent future threats. Security teams can also add key indicators from reported emails to monitored lists in Correlated Intelligence policies, improving detection and reducing manual effort.</p></li>

<li><p>Centralized policy resource management in Email and Collaboration Security</p>
<p>Email and Collaboration Security offers a centralized location for managing policy-related resources and performing email security operations across supported solutions. This feature allows administrators to define approved and blocked senders and content once and apply the settings consistently across supported solutions, including Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection and Cloud Email Gateway Protection. This reduces duplicated setup effort and ensures uniform enforcement. For solution-specific control, configurations can still be made individually.</p></li>
<li><p>Email tracking logs and audit logs integrated with Trend Vision One</p>
<p>Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection supports uploading mail tracking logs and audit logs to Trend Vision One, enabling you to query these logs directly in XDR Data Explorer and Audit Logs, and integrate them with third-party platforms via Third-Party Integrations.</p></li>
