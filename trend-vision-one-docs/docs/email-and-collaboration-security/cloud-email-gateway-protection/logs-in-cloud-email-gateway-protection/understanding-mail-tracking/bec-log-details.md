Cloud Email Gateway Protection provides detailed information for email messages detected as analyzed or probable Business Email Compromise (BEC) attacks. To view BEC attack details, click the **BEC Report** link in the **Actions** section on the **Mail Tracking Details** screen.

The possible reasons for BEC attack detections are the same as those for social engineering attack detections. See [Social engineering attack log details](./sea-log-details) for details.
