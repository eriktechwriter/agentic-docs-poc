---

Use a software management system such as Microsoft Intune to deploy the agent installer to your managed endpoints.

You can use a software management system to deploy the agent installer across your environment, making deployment and installation even easier. Deployment of Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agents is tested and supported for the following deployment methods:

- [Microsoft Intune](./deploying-agents-using-microsoft-intune)

- [Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager (formerly System Center Configuration Manager)](./deploy-agents-using-sccm)

- [Microsoft Active Directory Group Policy Object (GPO)](./deploying-agents-using-group-policy-objects)
