Trend Vision One Endpoint Security provides centralized and comprehensive Endpoint Security with a streamlined, single console experience – a single place to deploy protection and policy, manage risk, and handle detection and response for your endpoints, servers, and workloads.

The steps below are a brief summary of how to set up Endpoint Security.

1.  Access your Trend Vision One console and make sure you have updated to the Foundation Services release.

    For more information, see [Getting started with Trend Vision One](../../getting-started/getting-started-with-trend-vision-one).

2.  Configure Endpoint Security and provision your endpoint protection solutions.

    - For new Trend Micro customers, see [Setting up Endpoint Security for new Trend Micro customers](./setup-endpoint-security-for-new).

    - For current Trend Micro customers, see [Update Trend Micro Endpoint Solutions](./update-trend-micro-endpoint-solutions).
