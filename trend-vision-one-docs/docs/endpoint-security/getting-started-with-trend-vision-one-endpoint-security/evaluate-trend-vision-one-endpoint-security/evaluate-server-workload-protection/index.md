Move selected Trend Cloud One Endpoint & Workload Security agents to Server & Workload Protection to experience the new Trend Vision One Endpoint Security.

Before you move any agents to evaluate the new Trend Vision One Endpoint Security, ensure you have completed the following:

1.  Access the Foundation Services Update of the Trend Vision One console.

    - For new users, [activate your Trend Vision One console](../../../../getting-started/getting-started-with-trend-vision-one/trend-vision-one-access-tiers).

    - For current Trend Vision One users, [upgrade your console to the latest version](../../../../getting-started/getting-started-with-trend-vision-one/update-trend-vision-one-to-the-foundation-services-release).

2.  [Create a Server & Workload Protection instance](../../../../service-management/product-instance/creating-new-product-instance) in Product Instance.

    :::note
    You can provision up to five Server & Workload Protection Manager instances.

3.  [Deploy a Service Gateway and configure your firewall settings](../../deploy-a-service-gateway-and-configure-firewall-exceptions).
