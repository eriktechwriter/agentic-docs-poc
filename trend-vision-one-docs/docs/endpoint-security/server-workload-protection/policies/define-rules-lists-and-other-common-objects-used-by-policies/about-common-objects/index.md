The Common Objects pages (located under **Policies → Common Objects** in the Server & Workload Protection console) provide a way to define objects once so that you can reuse them various policies and rules. When you use one of the common objects in the policy or computer editor, its settings can be overridden for that specific policy or computer. For more information on how common object properties can be inherited and overridden at the policy or computer level, see [Policies, inheritance, and overrides](../../policies-inheritance-overrides).

:::tip
You can automate common object creation and configuration using the Server & Workload Protection API.
