title: View identified malware

View and manage files identified and quarantined by Server & Workload Protection to contain malware.

An identified file is a file that the agent found to be or to contain malware, and has been encrypted and moved to a special folder on the protected computer. To view identified files in Server & Workload Protection, go to access the Protection Manager and go to **Events & Reports → Events → Anti-Malware Events → Identified Files**.

Support for viewing and restoring files depends on the Anti-Malware configuration, and the operating system of the endpoint where the file was found:

- On Windows agents, you can view and restore [cleaned, deleted, or quarantined](../../../../configure-protection-modules/configure-anti-malware/anti-malware-set-up/configure-malware-scans/customize-malware-remedial-actions) files.

- On Linux agents, you can view and restore only quarantined files.

For information about events that are generated when malware is encountered, see [Anti-Malware events](..).

From the **Identified Files** list, you can take several actions:
