Use the QDecrypt tool to manually restore a downloaded file.

:::danger[Warning]
Restoring an infected file can spread the virus/malware to other files and computers. Before restoring the file, isolate the infected endpoint and move important files on this endpoint to a backup location.
:::

:::warning[Important]
The QDecrypt decryption tool only supports Windows.
:::

To manually restore an identified file, you can download the file and the decryption tool, QDecrypt, from Server & Workload Protection to your local machine. If you do not want Anti-Malware scan to detect the file again, make sure to create a scan exception first. Use the following steps to create the exclusion, download the file and tool, and restore the identified file on your local machine.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  In the Trend Vision One console, access the Server & Workload Protection instance managing the infected endpoint.

2.  Go to **Computers** and open the details for the affected computer.

4.  Locate the file you want to restore and click ![](/images/details=6adf47dd-913c-4586-8dcf-b57640800e39.webp) **View** to open the **Details** window.

    Use the filters or [advanced search](./search-for-identified-file) to find the file you want to restore.

5.  Copy the exact file name and original location.

6.  Go to **Anti-Malware → General**.

7.  Edit the **Malware Scan Configuration** for each scan type.

    Repeat these steps for **Real-Time Scan**, **Manual Scan**, and **Scheduled Scan**.

    1.  Under the scan type you want to configure, locate **Malware Scan Configuration** and click **Edit**.

    2.  Go to the **Exclusions** tab.

    3.  Enable **File List** and select a list to edit.

        :::note
        Select **New...** from the list of file lists if a list does not already exist.
        :::

    4.  To edit the file list, click **Edit**.

    5.  In the **File(s)** field, specify the original full file path of the file you want to restore.

        A full file path includes the root drive, all folder names, file name, and file extension. For example:

        `C:\Documents\example.doc`

    6.  Click **OK** to close the File List.

    7.  Click **OK** to close the Malware Scan Configuration.

8.  Once you have configured all scan types, click **Save** to apply the exception to the endpoint.

9.  With the computer details screen still open, go to **Anti-Malware → Identified Files**.

10. Select the file you want to restore and click ![](/images/anti_malware_quarantine_file_download=25f7c116-f13e-43b2-85da-522f0ddd848b.webp) **Download**.

12. To download the decryption tool, click **administration utility**.

    Your computer should automatically download `QFAdminUtil.zip`.

13. Locate the download package and unzip `QFAdminUtil.zip`.

14. Run QDecrypt.

    1.  To use the graphical interface, run `QDecrypt.exe`.

        Follow the steps to select the target encrypted file and where to save the decrypted file.

    2.  To use the command line interface, run `QDecrypt.com` with the following command:

        `qdecrypt [/h] [--verbose] /i <str> /o <str>`

        Where:

        - `/h` or `--help` displays the help message

        - `--verbose` generates verbose log messages

        - `/i <str>` or `--in=<str>` specifies the input encrypted file, where `<str>` is the file name

        - `/o <str>` or `--out=<str>` specifies the output unencrypted file, where `<str>` is the file name

        If you use the command line interface, for ease of use, move the encrypted file into the same location as the QDecrypt tool.

    The QDecrypt tool generates a decrypted file.
