The error message "Unable to Resolve Instance Hostname" may occur as a result of activating the Agent from Server & Workload Protection when you are not using agent-initiated activation.

We recommend that you always use *Agent-Initiated Activation*.To learn how to configure policy rules for agent-initiated communication and deploy agents using deployment scripts, see [Activate and protect agents using agent-initiated activation and communication](../../../../administration/manage-agents-protected-computers/activate-and-protect-agents-using-agent-initiated-activation-and-communication/agent-initiated-activation).
