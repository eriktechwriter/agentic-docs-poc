title: About Adding AWS Accounts
---

As of September 28, 2023, AWS accounts are now managed by the Cloud Accounts app. AWS accounts that were previously added to Server & Workload Protection are automatically added to the Cloud Accounts app as legacy connections.

[Update your legacy connections](../../../../../../cloud-security/cloud-accounts/aws-accounts/connect-and-update-aws-accounts/updating-legacy-aws-connection) in Cloud Accounts to enable advanced Trend Vision One Cloud Security features and capabilities.

You can still perform some management functions with Server & Workload Protection, as well as add, modify, or remove AWS accounts using API functions. However, Trend Micro recommends updating to the Cloud Accounts app to take full advantage of security benefits Trend Vision One has to offer for your containers and other cloud assets.
