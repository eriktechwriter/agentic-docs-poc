Default relays are available inside Server & Workload Protection. Agents should be able to use them if they can [connect to Server & Workload Protection](../../troubleshooting/swp-port-numbers).

:::note
[You might need more relays](./how-relays-work) if, for example, you have many computers and want to reduce Internet bandwidth costs.
