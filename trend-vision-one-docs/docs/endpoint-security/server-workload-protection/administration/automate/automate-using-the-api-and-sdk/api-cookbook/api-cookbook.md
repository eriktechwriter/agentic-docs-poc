Use the API Cookbook to perform specific tasks using cURL or PowerShell. Start with [Set Up to Use Bash or PowerShell](./set-up-to-use-bash-or-powershell/set-up-use-bash-or-powershell), and then you can move on to any other cookbook recipe:

- [Get a list of computers](./get-list-computers-bash-powershell)
- [Search for a policy](./search-for-a-policy-bash-and-powershell/search-for-policy-bash-powershell)
- [Assign a policy to a computer](./assign-a-policy-to-a-computer-bash-and-powershell/policy-computer-bash-powershell)
- [Assign a policy to many computers](./assign-a-policy-to-many-computers-bash-and-powershell/multi-policy-bash-powershell)
