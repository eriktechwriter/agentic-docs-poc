title: Are "Offline" agents still protected by Server & Workload Protection?
---

Agents showing as "Offline" in the Server & Workload Protection console are still being protected according to their last known configuration. However, they will not receive any software, security or policy updates until communication with Server & Workload Protection is restored.

For more information on how to bring an agent out of "Offline" status, see ["Offline" agent](../../events-reports/about-server-workload-protection-event-logging/system-events/agent-events/offline-agent/offline-agent).
