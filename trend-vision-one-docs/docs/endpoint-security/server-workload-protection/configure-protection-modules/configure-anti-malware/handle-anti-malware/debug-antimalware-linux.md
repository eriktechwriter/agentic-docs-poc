title: Increase debug logging for Anti-Malware in protected Linux instances
---

You can increase or decrease verbosity of the Anti-Malware (AM) debug logging used to diagnose any issue related to AM when running on a Linux operating system.

Anti-Malware debug logs are automatically included when you create a diagnostic package for technical support.

For information on creating a diagnostic package, see [Create a diagnostic package](../../../troubleshooting/create-a-diagnostic-package-and-logs/create-diagnostic-package-logs).

To increase the Anti-Malware debug log level, enter the following command in a shell on the Linux instance as a superuser:

`killall -USR1 ds_am`

This command will increase the level one unit. By default the level is 6 and the maximum is 8.

To decrease the Anti-Malware debug log level, enter the following command in a shell on the Linux instance as a superuser:

`killall -USR2 ds_am`

This command decreases the level by one unit. The minimum level is 0.

:::note
If your Linux distribution doesn't use killall you can substitute it with the pkill command.
