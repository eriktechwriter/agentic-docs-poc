The Endpoint Sensor functions have been replaced by the XDR for Endpoints (EDR) feature in Endpoint Security.

- To manage your Endpoint detection and response settings, see [Endpoint Security Policies (unified assignment)](../../../endpoint-security-configuration/endpoint-security-policies-unified-assignment).

- To override the Endpoint detection and response settings for individual endpoints, use the [policy override features in Endpoint Inventory](../../../endpoint-inventory).
