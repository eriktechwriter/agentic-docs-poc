Trend Micro Apex Central can group endpoints or users on the **Security Posture** tab based on the following information:

- Site locations

- Reporting line managers

By default, Trend Micro Apex Central synchronizes the user or endpoint site and reporting line information from Active Directory. You can configure custom site and reporting line groups to display compliance information.
