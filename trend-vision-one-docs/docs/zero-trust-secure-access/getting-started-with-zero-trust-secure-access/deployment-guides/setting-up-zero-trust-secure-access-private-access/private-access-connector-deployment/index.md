title: Private Access Connector deployment
---

Deploy one or multiple Private Access Connectors to the supported platforms.

Private Access Connectors connect your cloud-based and locally-installed applications with Zero Trust Secure Access Private Access, which allows you to control access to sensitive corporate resources. To ensure high availability (HA) and facilitate load-balancing on high traffic apps, install and group together at least 2 connectors in each environment. Before attempting to deploy the Private Access Connector, ensure that your environment meets the minimum [system requirements](../../../preparing-to-deploy-private-access-internet-access-and-ai-service-access-services/system-requirements/pa-connector-system-reqs).

:::note
A deployment guide appears the first time you access the **Private Access Configuration** app to help you set up the service.
