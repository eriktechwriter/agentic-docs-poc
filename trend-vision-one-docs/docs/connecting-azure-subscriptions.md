title: Connect and update Azure subscriptions
---

Add your Azure subscriptions or update legacy connections to provide visibility into your cloud environment.

Before you begin, ensure you have access to a sign-in or user role with administrator privileges for the subscription you wish to connect, and that you are logged into the subscription on a separate tab in the same browser instance as the Trend Vision One console. Review the [required permissions](azure-sub-required-permissions.md) and [regional limitations](azure-supported-regions-limitations.md) to ensure your cloud environment can support deploying Trend Vision One security resources.

Follow the links based on your subscription or deployment type:

- To connect a new Azure subscription, see [Connect an Azure subscription](adding-azure-subscription.md).

- To connect multiple Azure subscriptions in a management group, see [Connect an Azure Management Group](adding-azure-management-group.md).

- To update a legacy connection added by **Cloud Security Posture** and Server & Workload Protection, see [Updating a legacy Azure connection](updating-legacy-azure-connection.md).

- To connect or update multiple Azure subscriptions with a single app registration and service principal, see [Connect or update multiple Azure subscriptions](reducing-azure-connection-resources.md).
