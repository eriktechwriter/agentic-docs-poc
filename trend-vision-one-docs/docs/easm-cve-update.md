title: Enhanced vulnerability insights and updated CVE column naming for internet-facing assets
---

October 6, 2025—New enhancements in vulnerability management and asset profiling make it easier to prioritize and mitigate vulnerabilities in your internet-facing assets.

- A new CVE impact score column has been added to the internet-facing asset table within the Vulnerabilities factor in **Threat and Exposure Management**. This enhancement provides clearer visibility into the potential impact of each vulnerability, helping you prioritize remediation efforts more effectively.

- The "Highly Exploitable CVEs" column has been updated to "Total CVEs" in both the IP address asset table in **Attack Surface Discovery** and Related IPs in domain asset profiles. This change ensures more accurate and consistent terminology across the platform, making vulnerability data interpretation easier.

**Cyber Risk Exposure Management → Threat and Exposure Management**

**Cyber Risk Exposure Management → Attack Surface Discovery**
