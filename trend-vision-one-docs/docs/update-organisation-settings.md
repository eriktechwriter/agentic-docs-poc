Your Organisation details are populated by default based on the information provided while signing up for a Trend Vision One™ – Cloud Risk Management account.

As an Admin user, you can update your Organisation’s details i.e. Address, Time zone, Email, Telephone number, and White labeling logo to appear on the PDF reports from the *Administration* tab in your Cloud Risk Management account.

:::note
You can upload a White labeling logo up to a maximum height of 96 pixels. All images higher than 96 pixels are resized by default.

### Updating Organization Email {#updating-organization-email}

By default, your Organisation email is the one used to sign up with Cloud Risk Management as the first user. It is used as your contact email for all communications from Cloud Risk Management. Once you add more Administrators to your organization, you can update the email.

:::note
The Organization email must belong to an existing Admin user. One Organization can have only one Email. You cannot invite a user to more than one organization.
:::

To change the Organisation Email:

1.  Go to *Administration* \> *Organisation* and update the *Email* with the new email.

    :::note
    If there is no existing Administrator associated with the new email, you’ll first need to [invite a new user](add-user.md) to the Organisation as an Administrator. Once the new email address is verified, you can update the Organisation Email.
    :::

2.  Click on the *Update organisation settings* button to save your changes.

Optional: If you wish to discontinue an Organisation Email permanently, you can delete the associated user from *Administration* \> *Users* \> *Revoke User.*
