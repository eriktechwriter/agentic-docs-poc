title: Enhanced visibility for duplicate and inactive agents in Endpoint Inventory
---

October 13, 2025—Endpoint Inventory now provides enhanced visibility and messaging for duplicate and inactive agents, helping you to identify and clean up potential issues with cloned endpoints.

Endpoint Inventory can now flag inactive agents and provide warnings to clean up cloned agents before issues occur. Additionally, new inventory table columns, **Cloned endpoint type** and **Cloned agent configuration**, enhance filtering capabilities to locate persistent and non-persistent cloned endpoints in your inventory.

For more information about Endpoint Inventory columns, see [Endpoint Inventory table columns](endpoint-inventory-table-columns.md).
