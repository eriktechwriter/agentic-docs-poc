**Tag Management** allows you to create and manage tags, create rules to automatically tag your assets, map third-party organizational attributes into Trend Vision One, and gain centralized visibility into all the tags used by your organization. Leveraging asset tagging enables you to keep your assets organized and gain better insight into the structure of your organization.

The following table outlines the key actions available in **Tag Management**.
