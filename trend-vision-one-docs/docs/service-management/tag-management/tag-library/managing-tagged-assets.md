Select assets in Attack Surface Discovery, Endpoint Inventory, or Container Security and add or remove tags to enhance your asset organization.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Select one or more assets in Attack Surface Discovery, Endpoint Inventory, or Container Security.

2.  Click **Manage tags**.

    The **Manage tags for assets** window appears.

    The **Manage tags for assets** window displays your custom and platform tags in two tabs, and lists your selected assets under **Assets and assigned tags**.

    :::tip
    You can click **Remove asset** to stop managing tags for a given asset at any time. Any changes made before removing the asset are not saved.
    :::

3.  Assign additional tags to the assets.

    1.  On the **Custom tags** or **Platform tags** tabs, choose one or more tag properties or values.

        The selected tag values are now assigned to the assets, and appear under the assets in **Assets and assigned tags**.

    2.  Click **Save** to confirm assigning the tags to the assets.

        :::note
        For some platform tag properties, you can only assign one value of the tag property to an asset.

        For those tag properties, select one tag value to assign to all the selected assets. If you change your mind, you can click **Revert to original**.
        :::

4.  Remove tags from the assets.

    1.  On the **Custom tags** or **Platform tags** tabs, deselect one or more selected tag properties or values.

        The deselected tag properties and values are no longer assigned to the assets, and disappear from **Assets and assigned tags**.

        :::note
        For some platform tag properties, you can only assign one value of the tag property to an asset.

        For those tag properties, if you remove a tag value from an asset, the asset automatically resets to the system-defined tag value.
        :::

5.  You can add tag properties or tag values, depending on the tag type.

    - For custom tags, you can click **+ Add tag** to [create a new custom tag property](./create-custom-tags), **Manage** to edit the custom tag, or **+ Add tag value** to create new tag values.

    - For customizable platform tags, you can click **Manage** to edit the tag, or **+ Add tag value** to create a tag value.

6.  Click **Save** to confirm your changes.
