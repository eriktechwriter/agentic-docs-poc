title: Connect and update Google Cloud projects
---

Add your Google Cloud (GCP) projects to provide visibility into your cloud environment.

Before you begin, ensure you have access to a sign-in or user role with sufficient privileges for the project you wish to connect. For best results, sign into the project on a separate tab in the same browser instance as the Trend Vision One console. [Review the required permissions](gcp-required-permissions.md) to ensure your cloud environment can support deploying Trend Vision One security resources.

If you plan to enable Agentless Vulnerability & Threat Detection, determine whether you want to use a sidecar project and if you want Trend Vision One to automate the process. For more information, see [Get started with Agentless Vulnerability & Threat Detection in Google Cloud](get-started-google-cloud.md).
