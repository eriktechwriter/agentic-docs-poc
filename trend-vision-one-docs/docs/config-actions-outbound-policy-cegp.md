title: Customizable notifications for default global outbound virus and spam policy rules
---

September 16, 2025—Administrators with "Manage security policies and policy objects" permission and full domain visibility scope can now customize notification settings for default global outbound policy rules in Virus Scan and Spam Filtering. Options include enabling notifications, selecting notification templates, and configuring BCC recipients. This enhancement improves operational flexibility for security teams. For example, it allows them to alert internal stakeholders more effectively without compromising global protection rules.
