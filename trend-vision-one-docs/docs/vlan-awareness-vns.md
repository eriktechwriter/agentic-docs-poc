title: Support for VLAN awareness in Virtual Network Sensor
---

October 27, 2025—You can now configure Virtual Network Sensor in Network Inventory to be VLAN-aware, allowing the sensor to recognize and capture VLAN IDs. With this feature, the sensor can identify multiple VLANs operating on the same network and generate more accurate telemetry and detections.

For details, see [Sensor Details](sensor-details.md).
