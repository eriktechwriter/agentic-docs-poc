title: New Endpoint Security experience and Policy Resources coming soon
---

September 20, 2025—The new Endpoint Security Policy management and Policy Resources are releasing soon.

On October 31, 2025, Endpoint Security Policies will officially upgrade to the "unified assignment" experience. The new version of Endpoint Security Policies along with Policy Resources provide several key benefits:

- Assignments allow users to apply policies to endpoint groups across your security environment to simplify enforcement and management of security and compliance requirements.

- Policies simplify managing endpoint security settings by centralizing control for agent features, ensuring consistent configurations, security measures, and application settings across your security environment.

- Policy Resources make policy management more efficient by creating reusable resources, reducing redundancy, and maintaining consistency.

For more information about the new Endpoint Security Policies, see [Endpoint Security Policies (unified assignment)](endpoint-security-policies.md).
