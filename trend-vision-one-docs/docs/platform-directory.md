To customize your navigation bar for convenient access to useful apps, click the pin icon (![](/images/pin=bf365fd8-2cfb-4e4a-a97f-57bd7635c364.webp)) by any app group to add or remove the group from the navigation bar.

- Once you choose an app for your home page, you cannot unpin the corresponding app group.

- If you cannot pin an app group, your user account might not have access permissions for that group.

- **Resource Center** and **Help and Support** always show in the navigation bar.

Under **Directory**, you can view all Trend Vision One apps available to your business.

The available apps depend on the [access tier](accessing-your-console.md) of your business.

Click any app name to go to the app. If you cannot go to an app, your user account might not have access permissions for that app.

Under **AI Security**, you can explore all available AI-related solutions and apps in Trend Vision One.

Under **Pre-release features**, you can discover all Trend Vision One pre-release apps and features, and choose whether to opt in during the pre-release period.

:::warning[Important]
There is no charge for pre-release features before official release. For more information, see the [Pre-release disclaimer](pre-release-disclaimer.md).

By default, your business is not opted in to new pre-release apps and features. When you opt in to a pre-release app, the app appears in the navigation bar.

You can opt out of pre-release apps or features from Platform Directory at any time before official release. If you opt in to a pre-release app or feature and later opt out, you might lose access to related functionality, settings, and collected data after official release.

Only user accounts with the necessary permissions can opt in to or out of pre-release apps.
