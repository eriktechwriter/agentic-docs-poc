title: Enhanced user-reported email analysis and response in Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection
---

October 24, 2025—Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection offers enhanced capabilities for analyzing and responding to user-reported emails. When a user reports a suspicious message, the system automatically analyzes the email to determine whether it poses a threat—such as phishing or spam—and identifies key indicators like malicious URLs or suspicious senders. It also provides a list of recent emails that share similar suspicious indicators with the reported message, allowing administrators to apply manual or automatic actions to mitigate these threats.

In addition, Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection enhances detection capabilities by learning from the reported email to help prevent recurrence. Administrators can also add relevant objects—such as sender addresses, domains, or URLs—from the reported email to monitored lists used in Correlated Intelligence policies, helping block future unwanted or anomalous messages based on organizational context.
