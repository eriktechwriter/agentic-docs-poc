The Endpoint Sensor functions have been replaced by the XDR for Endpoints (EDR) feature in Endpoint Security.

- To manage your Endpoint detection and response settings, see [Endpoint Security Policies (unified assignment)](endpoint-security-policies.md).

- To override the Endpoint detection and response settings for individual endpoints, use the [policy override features in Endpoint Inventory](endpoint-inventory-intro-part.md).
