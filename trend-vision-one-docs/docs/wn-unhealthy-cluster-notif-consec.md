title: Unhealthy cluster notification for Container Security

September 10, 2025—Enabling this alert sends email or webhook notifications when your Container Security clusters become unhealthy. You can configure different clusters to send alerts to different recipients using cluster groups or tags, making it easier to manage a large number of clusters across different areas.

For more information, see [Alerts](alert-notifications.md).
