title: View Risk Subindex per asset group in Cyber Risk Exposure Management
---

October 8, 2024—Cyber Risk Overview now supports the ability to view and compare the Risk Index for specific subsets of assets. For example, you can monitor risk per business unit, region, information system, and more to determine which subset requires attention. To see the Risk Subindex, you must first build an asset grouping structure in **Asset Group Management** and allocate tag values to assets groups of either "Attack Surface Discovery" or "Tag Inventory App". For more information, see [Risk Overview](https://docs.trendmicro.com/en-us/documentation/article/trend-vision-one-risk-overview).
