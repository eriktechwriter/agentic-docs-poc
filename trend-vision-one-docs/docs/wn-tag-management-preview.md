October 20, 2025—Tag Management, which enables you to implement comprehensive asset tagging across the Trend Vision One platform, is now available for public preview. In Tag Management, you can create and manage tags, configure rules for automated asset tagging, map platform tags to third-party attributes, and gain centralized visibility into all Trend Vision One tags used by your organization. Leveraging asset tagging helps to keep your assets organized, enhancing your overall security posture and operational efficiency.

Tag Management includes several key features:

- Tag library: A centralized inventory of all your custom and platform tags, allowing you to easily view and organize your tags.

- Automated tagging: Create condition-based rules to automatically tag applicable assets when run, increasing efficiency and reducing manual effort.

- External tags: Define mapping relationships between Trend Vision One tag properties and organizational attributes from third-party sources including Microsoft Entra ID, Active Directory, and cloud service providers. This integration enables you synchronize and centrally manage tags from various sources.

- Execution results: A table view of the results of actions related to your automated tagging rules and external mappings, helping you monitor tagging activity across the platform.
