Endpoint Security provides a centralized location for managing detection and response on your endpoints. You can view detailed information in Endpoint Inventory, manage protection settings with Endpoint Security Policies, and deploy new agents.

- To get started with setting up your environment and deploying the Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agent, see [Getting started with Trend Vision One Endpoint Security](get-start-endpoint-security.md).

- To learn about reviewing and managing endpoints, see [Endpoint Inventory](endpoint-inventory-intro-part.md).

- To configure policies for your endpoints, see [Endpoint Security Configuration](endpoint-security-configuration.md).

- To configure your Protection Managers and endpoint security settings, see:

  - [Standard Endpoint Protection](standard-endpoint-protection.md)

  - [Server & Workload Protection](swp-intro-section.md)
