title: Managed configuration for Ivanti (MobileIron)
---

Integrate **Mobile Security** in Ivanti, formerly MobileIron, using managed configuration and allow Trend Vision One to protect your managed devices.

By configuring the managed configuration settings in your Ivanti management console, you can easily push the **Mobile Security for Business** app to your managed Android and iOS devices and start benefiting from increased device visibility and security. No API integration or individual device configuration is needed.

:::warning[Important]
If you manage both [Android](./ivanti-mobileiron-android) and [iOS](./ivanti-mobileiron-enrollment-ios) devices with Ivanti, you must configure the managed configuration settings for both types of device before all devices can be enrolled.
