title: Automatic bypass for Microsoft Teams meeting URLs in Time-of-Click Protection
---

September 16, 2025—Starting September 30, 2025, Microsoft Teams will begin validating meeting join URLs. Rewritten or modified URLs may be treated as malicious, which could interfere with email delivery and link protection features. To prevent false positives and ensure uninterrupted access to legitimate Teams meetings, Cloud Email Gateway Protection automatically bypasses URLs from teams.microsoft.com in Time-of-Click Protection.

This update helps maintain seamless meeting access while preserving accurate threat detection—no configuration required.
