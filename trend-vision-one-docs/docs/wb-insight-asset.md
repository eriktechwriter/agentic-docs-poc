title: Workbench insight asset visibility scope refinement
---

October 14, 2025—Streamline investigations and resolve information inconsistencies during cross-region security incidents. If displayed assets in a Workbench insight are outside the user asset visibility scope, the user is unable to take any actions on those assets. This enhancement ensures secure and efficient investigation processes while protecting organization assets.
