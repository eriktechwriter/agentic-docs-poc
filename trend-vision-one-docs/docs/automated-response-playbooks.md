title: Enhancements to Automated Response Playbooks
---

September 25, 2023—In addition to Workbench alerts automatically triggering playbook execution, users now have the option to manually trigger the execution of Automated Response Playbook from Workbench.

For more information, see [Investigate an alert](investigating-alert.md) and [Workbench insights alerts](alerts-workbench-insights.md) in the Workbench documentation.

Furthermore, the Automated Response Playbook now includes an additional automated response action: "Terminate processes". This enhancement enables users to automatically terminate any "unrated" target processes running on an endpoint.

For more information, see [Create Automated Response Playbooks](create-automated-response-playbooks.md).
