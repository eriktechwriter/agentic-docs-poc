:::warning[Important]
Updates to Server & Workload Protection components are managed by the Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agent.

To schedule updates, use the **Scheduled Tasks** in Server & Workload Protection. For more information, see [Schedule Server & Workload Protection to perform tasks](schedule-perform-tasks.md).

To manage updates and version control policies, use **Version Control Policies** in the Trend Vision One console. For more information, see [Version Control Policies](security-update-policies.md).

Use the information in this section only if you have not enrolled your Server & Workload Protection Manager in Version Control Policies. Protection Managers provisioned after December 2024 are automatically enrolled in Version Control Policies.
