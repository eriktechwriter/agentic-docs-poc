title: Extended query duration for user-reported emails in Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection
---

October 24, 2025—Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection allows administrators to search and view emails reported by end users for up to 90 days, expanding beyond the previous limits of 24 hours, 7 days, and 30 days. This longer retention period improves investigation capabilities, supports more thorough incident analysis, and helps security teams respond more effectively to delayed or complex threats.
