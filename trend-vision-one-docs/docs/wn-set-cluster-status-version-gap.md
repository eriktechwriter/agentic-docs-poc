title: Set cluster protection status by version gap
---

October 15, 2025—You can now set a cluster protection status for clusters in Container Security by a version gap, making it easier to keep your clusters updated. This setting changes the cluster protection status to "unhealthy" when the current deployed version falls behind the latest release by a predefined number of versions.

See [Inventory/Overview](container-inventory.md) for more information.
