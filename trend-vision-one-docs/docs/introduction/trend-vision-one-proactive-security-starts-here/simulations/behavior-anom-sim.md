title: Running the behavior anomaly network attack simulation
---

Run a behavior anomaly simulation in Trend Vision One with one deployed Virtual Network Sensor, Deep Discovery Inspector appliance, or connected TippingPoint SMS.

The behavior anomaly simulation requires that you prepare a [Deep Discovery Inspector appliance](../../../network-security/get-started-with-network-security/deep-discovery-inspector-connection-guides), [Virtual Network Sensor](../../../network-security/get-started-with-network-security/virtual-network-sensor-deployment-guides/deploy-a-virtual-network-sensor-with-vmware-esxi), or [TippingPoint SMS device](../../../network-security/get-started-with-network-security/tippingpoint-sms-connection-guides).

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  On the Trend Vision One console, click the **Resource Center** icon (![](/images/resourceCenter=73b1d431-813b-467c-8098-62f12bb6e2af.webp)).

2.  Click **Simulations**.

3.  Click **Network Attack**.

    The **Network Attack Simulations** window appears.

4.  Click ![](/images/simulationsRightArrow=20220525102311.webp) to navigate to **Behavior Anomaly Simulation**.

5.  Select a simulation from the drop-down list.

6.  Select a network appliance from the drop-down list.

7.  Specify a client IP and server IP.

8.  Click **Run simulation**.

9.  Go to **Cyber Risk Exposure Management → Threat and Exposure Management → Activity and behaviors → Anomaly Detections → Other events** to view the results.
