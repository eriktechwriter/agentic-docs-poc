title: User-defined security playbooks for CVEs with Global Exploit Activity are available
---

August 21, 2023—The Security Playbooks app made updates to the two CVEs with Global Exploit Activity playbook templates. It allows you to create the playbooks from scratch with a flexible workflow, while still allowing you to create the playbooks from a fully customizable template.

The updated playbook templates provide the following new filtering options to help mitigate risks posed by highly-exploitable CVEs on your managed assets for more fine-grained control:

- Filter targets by more operating systems, vulnerability process status, and Trend solutions for prevention rules

- Retrieve the number of assets targeted for the playbook right after the target configuration

- Notify recipients of playbook results by individual CVE or all CVEs
