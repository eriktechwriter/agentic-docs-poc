Manage the assets tagged with an individual tag value.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Click the ![](/images/simulationsRightArrow=20220525102311.webp) icon next to any tag property to expand the list of associated tag values.

2.  Click **Manage assets** next to any tag value, or click the number of **Tagged assets** for any given asset type.

    The **Manage tagged assets** window appears with a list of all assets tagged with the chosen tag value.

3.  Assign the tag value to more assets.

    1.  Click **+ Assign to assets**.

        The **Assign tag to assets** window appears.

    2.  Filter by a specific asset type to show available assets.

    3.  Select one or more assets to assign the tag value to.

        :::note
        You cannot select assets that the tag is already assigned to, or which already have 20 custom tag values assigned.
        :::

    4.  Click **Assign tag**.

4.  Remove the tag from assets.

    1.  In the **Manage tagged assets** window, select one or more assets tagged with the chosen tag value.

    2.  Click **Remove tag**.

        :::note
        For some platform tag properties, you can only assign one value of the tag property to an asset.

        If you remove the tag value from an asset with no other tags, the asset is instead tagged with the system-defined tag value for that property.
