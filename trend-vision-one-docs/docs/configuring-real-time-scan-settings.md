### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Select the following options:

    - **Enable virus/malware scan**

    - **Enable spyware/grayware scan**

      :::note
      You must enable virus/malware scanning before you can enable spyware/grayware scanning. During a virus outbreak, the Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agent automatically enables Real-time Scan and you cannot disable scanning until the outbreak ends. Real-time Scan helps prevent the virus from modifying or deleting files and folders on endpoints.
