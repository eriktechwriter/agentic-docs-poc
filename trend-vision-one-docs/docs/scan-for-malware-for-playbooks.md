title: Support for Scan for Malware in security playbooks
---

October 27, 2025—You can now add the Scan for Malware response action to the following playbooks:

- Risk Event Response playbooks

- Automated Response Playbooks

- Endpoint Response playbooks

This feature helps you quickly initiate a malware scan on endpoints during investigations, improving threat containment and reducing the risk of lateral movement.

For details on the requirements to run the Scan for Malware action, see [Create Risk Event Response playbooks](creating-risk-reduction-playbooks.md), [Create Automated Response Playbooks](create-automated-response-playbooks.md), and [Create Endpoint Response playbooks](create-endpoint-response-playbooks.md).
