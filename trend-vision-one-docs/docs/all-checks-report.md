The All Checks report provides the success and failure of all Rules enabled and active on your Account, Group, or Organisation. These can be viewed by *Rule,* *Resource,* or [Compliance Standard](compliance-reports.md) to prioritize [failed checks for resolution](failed-check-resolution.md). You can also view all excluded resources in your account.

1.  Generate [Configured reports](configured-reports.md)
2.  [Filter checks](filter-search.md)
3.  [Generate report](generate-download-report.md)
