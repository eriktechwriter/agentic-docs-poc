title: Enable anti-malware scanning for AWS
---

Scan your AWS EBS, ECR, and Lambda resources for malware to help identify threats, prioritize remediation efforts, and secure cloud workloads.

Agentless Vulnerability & Threat Detection provides anti-malware scanning for potential threats, such as viruses, Trojans, and spyware, in your AWS EBS, ECR, and Lambda resources. Anti-malware scanning is not enabled for AWS by default. You may enable the feature at any time in [Cloud Accounts](../../../../../cloud-security/cloud-accounts) for existing AWS accounts or when deploying a new CloudFormation template. If you enable anti-malware scanning on an existing AWS account, scanning begins during the next daily scan. Scan times are not configurable.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  Go to **Cloud Security → Cloud Accounts → AWS** and click **Add Account**.

2.  Choose CloudFormation as the deployment method, select **Single AWS Account**, and click **Next**.

3.  Specify the general information for the account and click **Next**. For more details, see [Connect an AWS account using CloudFormation](../../../../../cloud-security/cloud-accounts/aws-accounts/connect-and-update-aws-accounts/adding-aws-account).
