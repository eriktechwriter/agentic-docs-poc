The Misconfiguration and Compliance section of Cloud Risk Management provides high-level metrics on the compliance status of all your cloud accounts, not only individually, but also in total or as a user-defined [Group](./manage-cloud-accounts/account-settings/manage-account-groups/grouped-accounts). Metrics are organized into dashboard sections.
