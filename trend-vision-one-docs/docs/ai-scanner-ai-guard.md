**AI Application Security** enables you to intercept malicious inputs and block potentially harmful outputs from your AI models, which helps to prevent exploitative usage and maintain regulatory compliance. If your data needs to remain local, choose self-hosted instead of hosted by Trend Micro.

Go to **Cloud Security → Security for AI Stack → AI Application Security** and click **Get started** for the tool that meets your need:

- [AI Scanner](configure-ai-scanner-scan-settings.md): Scan your AI models for common attack techniques and objectives to prevent malicious use and ensure regulatory compliance.

  For more information on configuring a scan, see [Configure AI scan settings](configure-ai-scanner-scan-settings.md).

- [AI Guard](integrate-ai-guard.md): Configure settings to scan your AI usage for harmful content generation, sensitive information leakage, and prompt injections.

  For more information on integrating AI Guard with your application, see [Integrate AI Guard](integrate-ai-guard.md).
