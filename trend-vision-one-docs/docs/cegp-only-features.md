<td><p>Detection improvements</p></td>
<td><ul>
<li><p>Enhanced virus scan capability to detect .alz and .egg archive files</p>
<p>Cloud Email Gateway Protection supports detection of .alz and .egg compressed files in both inbound and outbound email traffic. Once extracted, file contents are scanned by the Advanced Threat Scan Engine (ATSE) and Virtual Analyzer (if enabled) according to the configured virus policy rules. Additionally, for inbound emails, if File Password Analysis is enabled, encrypted .alz and .egg files will be decrypted using the retrieved password, then scanned by ATSE and Virtual Analyzer (if enabled), ensuring comprehensive protection against hidden threats.</p></li>
<li><p>Email address modification to change the recipient or sender addresses before delivery</p>
<p>Cloud Email Gateway Protection supports email address modification, a feature that allows administrators to rewrite sender or recipient addresses in message envelopes or headers and modify domains in email addresses. This enhancement improves mail flow control, supports advanced routing scenarios, and helps enforce organizational policies and compliance requirements.</p></li>

<td><p>Usability and management</p></td>
<td><ul>
<li><p>Company logo customization available for time-of-click protection</p>
<p>You can upload your company logo to replace the default Trend Micro logo when configuring the blocking and warning redirect pages for time-of-click protection. End users will see the customized logo when they encounter a blocked or warning page after clicking a potentially malicious URL. This enhancement strengthens your brand presence and provides a seamless and familiar experience for your users in security alerts.</p></li>
<li><p>Extended retention period for mail tracking and policy event logs</p>
<p>Cloud Email Gateway Protection allows administrators to query mail tracking and policy event logs retained for up to 180 days.</p></li>
<li><p>Enhanced management for phishing simulation integration</p>
<p>Cloud Email Gateway Protection offers enhanced management capabilities for third-party phishing simulation integrations. Administrators can manage approved service providers and their corresponding sending IP addresses directly through the administrator console, allowing Cloud Email Gateway Protection to bypass scans for phishing simulation emails from approved third-party service providers.</p></li>

<td><p>Platform-powered capabilities</p></td>
<td><ul>
<li><p>Centralized policy resource management in Email and Collaboration Security</p>
<p>Email and Collaboration Security offers a centralized location for managing policy-related resources and performing email security operations across supported solutions. This feature allows administrators to define approved and blocked senders and content once and apply the settings consistently across supported solutions, including Cloud Email Gateway Protection and Cloud Email and Collaboration Protection. This reduces duplicated setup effort and ensures uniform enforcement. For solution-specific control, configurations can still be made individually.</p></li>
<li><p>Integration with Domain Verification under Administration</p>
<p>Cloud Email Gateway Protection integrates with the domain verification feature in Trend Vision One. Domains added in Cloud Email Gateway Protection automatically appear in the <strong>Domain Verification</strong> screen under <strong>Administration</strong>. This integration also allows administrators to verify domains in either Cloud Email Gateway Protection or <strong>Domain Verification</strong>, with the verification results applying to both locations.</p></li>
<li><p>Mail tracking logs for accepted traffic and audit logs integrated with Trend Vision One</p>
<p>Cloud Email Gateway Protection supports uploading mail tracking logs for accepted traffic and audit logs to Trend Vision One, enabling you to query these logs directly in XDR Data Explorer and Audit Logs, and integrate them with third-party platforms via Third-Party Integrations.</p></li>
