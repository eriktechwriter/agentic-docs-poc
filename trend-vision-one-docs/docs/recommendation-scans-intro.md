Server & Workload Protection can run recommendation scans on computers to help identify which rules you should apply or remove for Intrusion Prevention, Integrity Monitoring, and Log Inspection. The resulting recommendations are a good place to start when establishing security rules. However, you may need [additional rules](additional-rules-vulnerabilities.md) for common vulnerabilities. You can [exclude a rule or application type from recommendation scans](exclude-recommendation-scans.md) and [manually assign rules](manual-assign-rules.md) as well as [automatically implement recommendations](auto-imp-recommendations.md).

Agents that support the [enhanced recommendation scan](enhanced-reco-scan.md) display ![enhanced recommendation scan indicator](/images/ers-indicator=9c2a1e5d-d595-47db-8d06-90c36cb6e2c0.webp) next to Agent on the Overview page. Agents that do not meet the requirements for the enhanced recommendation scan automatically use the [classic recommendation scan](classic-reco-scan.md) instead.

Recommendation information is not available on the policy pages.
