---

February 26, 2024—In line with enhancements to the visualization of asset relationships in **Attack Surface Discovery**, the asset graph feature in profile screens for [devices](device-profile.md), [accounts](account-profile.md), [domains](domain-profile.md), and [IP addresses](ip-address-profile.md) has been renamed to Asset Risk Graph, while the graph view for [cloud assets](cloud-assets.md) is now the [Cloud Risk Graph](cloud-risk-graph.md). Both of these features continue to provide valuable risk findings, helping you assess your organization's security posture.

**Cyber Risk Exposure Management → Attack Surface Discovery**
