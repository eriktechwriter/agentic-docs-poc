Connect your account to enable cloud security features and give Trend Vision One greater visibility and protection over your cloud assets.

Connecting your Alibaba Cloud account allows various Trend Vision One apps and security features to access your cloud assets and gain greater visibility over assets and monitor for potential threats. The core features deployed when connecting enable the following Trend Vision One apps and features to monitor your cloud environment:

- **Cyber Risk Exposure Management → Attack Surface Discovery → Cloud Assets**

  For more information, see [Cloud assets](../../../cyber-risk-exposure-management/continuous-risk-management/attack-surface-discovery/cloud-assets).

- **Cyber Risk Exposure Management → Attack Surface Discovery → APIs**

  For more information, see [APIs](../../../cyber-risk-exposure-management/continuous-risk-management/attack-surface-discovery/apis).

- **Cyber Risk Exposure Management → Cloud Risk Management**

  For more information, see [Cloud Risk Management](../../../cyber-risk-exposure-management/security-posture-management/cloud-risk-management).

- **Endpoint Security → Server & Workload Protection**

  Your Alibaba virtual machines can be viewed and managed in Server & Workload Protection like any other computer. These instances are tree structures and are treated as computer groups.

:::note
Your Alibaba assets appear in the Endpoint Inventory list. Assets without the Trend Vision One Endpoint Security agent installed appear as [unmanaged endpoints](../../../endpoint-security/endpoint-inventory/trend-vision-one-endpoint-security-endpoint-inventory-faq/endpoint-list-faq).
