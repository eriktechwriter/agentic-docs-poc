title: Connect and update Azure subscriptions
---

Add your Azure subscriptions or update legacy connections to provide visibility into your cloud environment.

Before you begin, ensure you have access to a sign-in or user role with administrator privileges for the subscription you wish to connect, and that you are logged into the subscription on a separate tab in the same browser instance as the Trend Vision One console. Review the [required permissions](../../get-started-with-cloud-accounts/cloud-accounts-required-permissions/azure-sub-required-permissions) and [regional limitations](../azure-supported-regions-limitations) to ensure your cloud environment can support deploying Trend Vision One security resources.

Follow the links based on your subscription or deployment type:

- To connect a new Azure subscription, see [Connect an Azure subscription](./adding-azure-subscription).

- To connect multiple Azure subscriptions in a management group, see [Connect an Azure Management Group](./connect-an-azure-management-group).

- To update a legacy connection added by **Cloud Security Posture** and Server & Workload Protection, see [Updating a legacy Azure connection](./updating-legacy-azure-connection).

- To connect or update multiple Azure subscriptions with a single app registration and service principal, see [Connect or update multiple Azure subscriptions](./connect-or-update-multiple-azure-subscriptions).
