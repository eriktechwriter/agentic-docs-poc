title: 1.2.24 - Ensure that the –tls-cert-file and –tls-private-key-file arguments are set as appropriate (Automated)
---

Profile applicability: Level 1 - Master Node

Setup TLS connection on the API server.

API server communication contains sensitive parameters that should remain encrypted in transit. Configure the API server to serve only HTTPS traffic.

:::note
By default, `--tls-cert-file` and `--tls-private-key-file` are presented and created for use.
:::

### Impact {#impact}

TLS and client certificate authentication must be configured for your Kubernetes cluster deployment.

### Audit {#audit}

Run the following command on the Control Plane node:

``` codeblock
ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver
```

Verify that the `--tls-cert-file` and `--tls-private-key-file` arguments exist and they are set as appropriate.

### Remediation {#remediation}

Follow the Kubernetes documentation and set up the TLS connection on the apiserver. Then, edit the API server pod specification file `/etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml` on the master node and set the TLS certificate and private key file parameters.

``` codeblock
--tls-cert-file=<path/to/tls-certificate-file>
--tls-private-key-file=<path/to/tls-key-file>
```
