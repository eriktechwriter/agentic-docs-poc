The Most critical failures section displays the top 15 failed [Checks](../../../../../cyber-risk-exposure-management/security-posture-management/cloud-risk-management/misconfiguration-and-compliance/misconfiguration-and-compliance-rules/checks/model-check/model-check) sorted by risk level against *All account,* *Individual accounts,* or *Groups*, and can be viewed either by *rule* or by *resource.* We recommend that you take [corrective actions](../../../../../cyber-risk-exposure-management/security-posture-management/cloud-risk-management/misconfiguration-and-compliance/misconfiguration-and-compliance-rules/checks/failed-check-resolution/failed-check-resolution) on the most critical failures first as these failures potentially expose your organization to high-level security vulnerabilities, cost inefficiencies, performance, reliability, or other issues.
