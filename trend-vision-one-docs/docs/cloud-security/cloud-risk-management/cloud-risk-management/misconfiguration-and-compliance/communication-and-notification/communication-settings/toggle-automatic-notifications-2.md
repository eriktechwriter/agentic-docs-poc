By default, Automatic Notifications are set to *OFF* for [all communication channels](../../../../../../cyber-risk-exposure-management/security-posture-management/cloud-risk-management/misconfiguration-and-compliance/communication-and-notification/communication-channels/communication-integrations). If you want to receive notifications after the [Compliance scan](../../../../../../cyber-risk-exposure-management/security-posture-management/cloud-risk-management/misconfiguration-and-compliance/compliance-scan-help/cloudIdentityBot) runs, set automatic notifications to *ON.*
