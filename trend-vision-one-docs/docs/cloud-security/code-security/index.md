Code Security enables efficient threat remediation and enhances security throughout the software development lifecycle by performing pre-runtime scans on artifacts. Enable Code Security to scan artifacts in your environment for vulnerabilities, malware, and secrets.

Go to **Cloud Security → Code Security** to get started.

1.  [Integrate Trend Micro Artifact Scanner (TMAS) to your CI/CD pipeline](../container-security/log/container-image-scanning/trend-micro-artifact-scanner-tmas/integrate-trend-micro-artifact-scanner-tmas-into-a-cicd-pipeline).
2.  [Analyze scan results in Artifacts inventory](./artifacts-inventory-code-security).
3.  [Create policy rules](./code-security-policies) for vulnerabilities, malware, and secrets and [create scan overrides](../container-security/log/container-image-scanning/trend-micro-artifact-scanner-tmas/what-to-do-after-the-artifact-scanner-scans/override-vulnerability-findings) if needed.
