title: Manual Scans for AWS buckets
---

You can run a manual scan on your AWS buckets at anytime. This scan includes all files in the bucket, not just recently uploaded or modified files.

If at least one of the selected buckets has scanning enabled, the buckets that do not have scanning enabled are enabled when you run the manual scan. If none of the selected buckets have scanning enabled, you must enable scanning before you can run the scan.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  On the **File Security Inventory** page, select the AWS account.

2.  Select the buckets.

3.  From **Scan settings**, select **Manual scan**.

4.  Ensure that **Scanning** is enabled.

5.  Click **Scan**.
