title: Scheduled scans for AWS buckets
---

If you are using File Security Storage, you can schedule your scanning at specified intervals. You can schedule multiple buckets at once or one at a time. Selecting multiple buckets is useful if they share the same scanning schedule, while selecting a single bucket is useful if you want a different schedule for a specific bucket.

### Procedure {#procedure}

1.  On the **File Security Inventory** page, select the AWS account.

2.  Select the buckets that have **Scanning on**.

3.  From **Scan settings**, select **Modifying scanning**.

4.  Ensure that **Scanning** is enabled.

5.  Select **Scheduled scan**.

6.  Select the **Schedule values**.

7.  Enter the scan time using a 24-hour clock.

8.  Click **Save**.
